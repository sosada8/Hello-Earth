# Hello-Earth
Just the first Repository with out no code.
Mick here I would like to know more about Network Programming. 
Not only the Theory is my interesst, but also the Practical part. However I have no Idea where to start today. 
I have installed Python, Atom and I have an account here in GutHub and I hope 
to find some experts to show me the way to achieve my Goals to be a Network Programmer soon.
